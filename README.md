# 2030ICT---Introduction-to-Big-Data-Analysis

---
**Overview**
In this assignment, you will need to apply data analytics, using the tools introduced during the labs.
You are required to study and analyse the SEEK job market data for which a dataset is provided. The
assignment consists of 2 parts.
In the first part (Assessment 2), you will need to understand data characteristics using data preparation
and preprocessing techniques. Then, you will perform various data analysis techniques to gain better
understandings about the dataset.
In this 2nd part (Assessment 3), you will need to perform more advance techniques to explore the dataset
deeper. You also need to propose solutions for some challenges which are based on real-life situations.

#Section 1 – Data Analysis and Interpretation.

**1. Analyse by comparison**
Choose your two favourite cities/locations. We will explore the difference between them by
answering the following questions:
✓ Which city has more job? How many jobs each type (casual, fulltime, etc.) are there in each
city? (1 point)
✓ In each city, which are top 5 job sectors? How many jobs are there in each sector? (1 point)
✓ Visualise the top 5 job sectors in pie chart for each city.* (1.5 point)
✓ In each city, list the job salary range with the corresponding number of jobs. Which city is
more well-paid? (1 point)
✓ List top 5 companies in each city? Which sectors do they belong to? (1 point)
✓ Between 2 cities, which do you think it is better for employees. Explain your choice.* (1.5
point)

**2. Analyse by time. **
In this part, we will analyse the jobs based on the posting date.
✓ Visualise the number of job posts by month. (1 point)
✓ Visualise the number of job posts by day of week. (1 point)
✓ Visualise the number of job posts by day of the month. (1 point)
✓ Visualise trending of the job postings for the big cities.* (2 points)
✓ Based on the above charts, provide your observation about the number of job posts over time.
Give your own conclusion. (2 points)

**3. Forecasting and skill extractions.**
✓ Using moving average for 7 days and 30 days to predict the number of job postings and
visualise them in line chart. Which one creates a better prediction? Explain your choice.** (3
points)
✓ Choose your favourite job sector/sub-sector, then use TF/IDF to extract important keywords.
Visualise them in word cloud chart (hint: you can use the online tool
https://wordart.com/create or similar websites)**. (3 points)
